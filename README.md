# Matrix-Calculator

A C++ console application which can perform the following operations on matrices:
1. Sum of two matrices
2. Multiplication of matrix by scalar
3. Division of matrix by scalar
4. Multiplication of matrix by matrix
5. Raising a matrix to a power
6. Finding the determinant
7. Finding the inverse matrix
8. Transposition of matrix
9. Matrix equation

The program receives matrices in the form of text files. After that it validates that
the operation is possible, executes it and prints the result on the console. If the 
user wants, the result of the operation is stored in the folder containing the example 
matrices. 

In order to be more useful and complete, the application supports the execution of
more than one operation one after another, until the user decides to stop.
